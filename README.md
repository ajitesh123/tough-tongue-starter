# Tough Tongue AI - Course Creation Boilerplate

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) boilerplate project for creating interactive online courses powered by [Tough Tongue AI](https://app.toughtongueai.com/).

## About This Boilerplate

This template provides a starting point for building voice-enabled course websites using Tough Tongue AI. It serves as a sample prototype that demonstrates:

- **Course Landing Page**: Customizable template with placeholders for course name, modules, and benefits
- **Voice-Powered Learning**: Integration with Tough Tongue AI's conversational capabilities for interactive learning
- **Modern UI Components**: Ready-to-use components designed specifically for course creators

## Features for Course Creators

- **Interactive Learning Modules**: Create conversation-based learning modules where students can practice with AI
- **Customizable Course Structure**: Easily modify course modules, descriptions, and learning objectives
- **Enrollment Management**: Built-in components for course registration and student onboarding
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface that works across all devices

## API Integration

- **API Documentation**: [https://app.toughtongueai.com/docs/api-integration/](https://app.toughtongueai.com/docs/api-integration/)
- **Create API Key**: [https://app.toughtongueai.com/developer/](https://app.toughtongueai.com/developer/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start customizing your course by modifying `app/page.tsx`. Replace the placeholder text with your course name, module descriptions, and unique selling points.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
